# York University HP Plotter Art 1970
*Arthur Ryman, last updated 2025-10-29*

This repo contains art I created in 1970 at York University using an HP plotter located in
the Math Department.

Each plot was created by connecting successive points that on a
[Lissajou curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve) that are separated
by some large, fixed parameter delta value. 
Using a very small delta would produce a smooth curve. 
Using a large delta produces "string" art. 
The intersection points of the strings produce interesting secondary curves.

I scanned the original paper plots using an Epson FastFoto FF-680W scanner.
The scanner software produces both a verbatim copy, e.g. FastFoto_0025.jpg,
and an enhanced version, e.g. FastFoto_0025_a.jpg.

The HP plotter was a standalone device, not connected to any computer.
The programs were store on small magnetic cards.
Due to the lack of connectivity on the plotter, my only option was to create plots
from simple mathematical procedures, hence the use of Lissajou curves.

I plan to recreate the math in Python programs. 
Each plot is described three parameters, namely two frequencies and the delta.
I can then give the plots meaning titles.
Watch this space.
